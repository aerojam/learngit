Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. It provides powerful tools for tracking changes, collaborating with others, and managing different versions of a project. By using Git, teams can streamline their development process, maintain a clear history of their work, and easily revert to previous states if needed.
